# Sensitive Environment Variables (e.g., API keys, passwords)
# It's HIGHLY recommended NOT to commit sensitive data in Environments.
# Store them as local variables in Postman or use environment-specific files outside Git.
# If your environment JSON contains sensitive data, IGNORE it:
# my_environment.postman_environment.json
